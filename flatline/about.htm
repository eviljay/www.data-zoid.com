<B> What is the Flatline? </B> <Br> <Br>

<P> Cheap gag I know. Well, Flatline (Flat to his friends) is, in reality,
a 23 year old male from England.
Born at the tail end of the 70s Flat seems to exist in a kind of duality in everything he does.
</P>
<P> From a very early age Flat was devouring his father's SF book collection at a rate of knots
at the detriment of any other genre. To this day, Flat rarely reads anything other than SF and
Fantasy. </P>
<P> Whilst studying at school with the eventual goal of become the man who invents the cure to 
cancer (partial success to date), Flat spent his free time learning to play the piano. Whilst 
he is classically trained he mainly listens to, and plays, rock, blues and country on, by now, 
a varied list of instruments. </P>
<P> Continuing the duality, he studied at high school in science whilst teaching part-time at a
local music school. Upon "making the grade" he headed off to University to study biochemistry </P>
<P> Whilst studying this immensely complex and technical subject, Flat took to heavy drinking,
live action roleplay and <drum roll> the internet. It was here at University that Flat first
discovered chat. He's never left Arts & Entertainment, Television, but over 4 years has become a
regular member of 3 rooms communties </P>
<P> Upon dropping out of University (any of you suprised?), Flat went through a very dark patch
in life, survived only through the judicial use of music and some very dear friends. Then he 
found Aston University. </P>
<P> Flat is still working at Aston, ostensibly as a technician but generally rather more varied, 
still in chat and still a musician. He precariously balances a life of phytochemical (look it up)
research, writing and playing music, and spending hours in chat and working on websites. Recently,
the addition of a blossoming relationship has been added to this maelstrom of fields, concepts and
skills. Nine months in, and he's more in love than he's ever been before. Everything's just peachy 
right now. </P>

<P> Thanks for listening <Br>
Flat. </P>
