<Tr><Td>
<B>Iain Banks</B> - My favourite authour. Writer of all things SF but mainly about his own Universe and
society, originally named <I>"The Culture".</I> Quite a cerebral read, but action-packed and well
characterised. I recommend you start from the beginning with <I>Consider Phlebas.</I>
<Br><Br>
<B>William Gibson</B> - SF again. Been around sometime now, considered by some to be the originator
of the <I>cyberpunk</I> genre. The books all set in a feasible future not THAT far from hours. Again
plenty of action and strong characters. Start with <I>Neuromancer</I>, a little dated but still
very good and you might recognise a certain name ;)
<Br><Br>
<B>Robert Rankin</B> - Fantasy! At last, some of you cry. In my opinion, far better than that <I>
Pratchett</I> chap. Rankin, a master of the surreal, still manages to produce a coherant story at
the end of it, though God only knows how. Very funny, easy to read, and plenty of recurring characters
and locations to watch for. Start anywhere you please, the timeline appears to jump all over the place
and they're not really connected other than by the area in which they are set, the REAL location of
Brentford, England.
