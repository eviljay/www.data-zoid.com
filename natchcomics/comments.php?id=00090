<span class="med">Wait, I was supposed to have a stockpile? I do have some memories of at times keeping 10 comics ahead, but they could have been alcoholic-stupor dreams.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm told to post, so I post like the puppet on a string that I am. Avoiding a bit of work at the moment, namely a report on passages written in around the 14th century and how language has change. Basically, they hadn't invented spelling at that time and we were still ruthlessly stealing words from france in daring coastal raids that nearly wiped out the word stores of 1370. Oh, and there are innumerable squiggly things.<br />
<br />
Fascinating as that is for anyone who isn't doing my course (And you can imagine how fascinating it is for us. No wonder english students have a reputation for laziness), I'll move on. Still thinking about going to amsterdam for a year, which'd be cool. Although looking at some of the exchange students around here I hope I won't look through dutch eyes as they do in mine. If that makes sense. You know what I mean.<br />
<br />
I still don't know why I am again using this as my own horrible parody of a blog. Oh yes. I was told to post.<br />
<br />
Blame Dan!<br />
<br />
Oh yes. Dan, the word bubbles confuse me. Have the triangle things at least pointing towards the person who's speaking in future. Some obviously stupid people might have trouble working out who said what.<br />
<br />
I'm not stupid! I have books!</span><BR><BR>
