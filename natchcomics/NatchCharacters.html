        &quot;magic powers&quot; which he will call upon in time

        of dire need, or when someone annoys him. He's actually

        the author of the strip, though after deciding that every

        author gag under the sun has been done, stopped

        referencing this. Much. He gave up on one storyline

        because it got boring, and so gained the energy to go

        daily, and occasionally updates on time. He currently

        runs the comic using the idea of &quot;If they're my

        friends, and they give me a sprite, they're in.&quot;

        It's a bad idea to let him watch the Matrix.</span></td>

        which probably goes to show why Lou was the only good

        thing to come out of it. RL Dan knows Lou from college.

        Comic Dan knows Lou from the new character auditions. Lou

        is an extrovert, and is constantly fending off the

        advances of Mike. She has a thing for pink, a severe

        dislike of all of Dan's music, and enjoys kicking people

        in the nuts.</span></td>

        co-ordinator, both in-comic and out. It was Mike's idea

        to hold the new character auditions, which led to such

        delights as Megaman's brick impression, and Sonic the

        Hedgehog in a cameo role. He finds it hard to resist

        staring at Lou's boobs, has a fondness for swords and

        Chow-Yun Fat movies, and is smarter than he appears.

        Probably. He is <span class="yellowmed">Sean's </span>drinking partner,

        and together they have consumed enough to kill Barney

        Gumble. He hides a deep, dark secret, which is to be

        revealed in comic 109...</span></td>

        plotting to take over the world, the comic, or just

        confuse the hell out of Dan, he's rarely to be seen

        without a beer can in his hand. He hides an impressive

        arsenal of weaponry within his leather jacket, which has

        TARDIS-like qualities. He's usually pissed off at Dan for

        something, and even shot him once, though he maintains it

        was an accident.</span></td>

        fierce White stripes fan, as is evidenced in his dress,

        and probably the most normal one in the comic. Wilo

        started as a character in the original Natch Comics

        storyline, until Dan gave up on it - The sudden change of

        scenery explained later as a move to a &quot;different

        dimension&quot;. Wilo was quite pissed off at Dan for

        doing that, as it meant he had to run away from the evil

        Joe a bit more.</span></td>
