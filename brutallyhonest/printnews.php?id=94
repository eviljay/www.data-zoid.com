It's crap.<br />
<br />
It suffers from all the same issues as the actual Van Helsing movie, not the least of which is an ABSURDLY RIDICULOUS PLOT which takes "artistic" liberties aplenty with famous literary charcters..and the British Royal Family.<br />
<br />
Summary of said "plot":<br />
<br />
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, masquerading (I assume) as Jack The Ripper start bumping off women on London street corners. Jekyll/Hyde use the life force of said women to (I'm not making this up) rejuvenate the then-70-year-old Queen Victoria into a spritely 20-year-old who has no memory of her Queendom. Jekyll, obviously planning ahead with the skill and dexterity of any great Hollywood villian, intends to marry (and presumably bonk) the now-young Queen, without a concern whatsoever for the fact that the Royal Family doesn't take kindly to their monarchs mysteriously vanishing. This issue is not touched upon.<br />
<br />
Enter Van Helsing and Irritating Little Monk(tm).<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty predictable. Bonus points solely for the fairly well constructed underground train collision. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, the DVD probably makes a great coaster.</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=94</a></font></center>
