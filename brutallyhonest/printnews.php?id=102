It has perhaps one of the best opening scenes I've ever seen in a film. The way it mocks the American outlook on the world and through our entertainment is absolutely masterful.<br />
<br />
It starts out real well, but kind of tapers off as the movie goes along and attempts to detail a story. That's the weakness of the film, plain and simple. The second half simply isn't as funny as the first, so it almost seems a let down.<br />
<br />
Though at any moment you can cause yourself to chuckle just by realizing you're wathing puppets. And just because the second half isn't as laugh-out-loud funny, it does involve more cerebral satire in between all the low brow humor.<br />
<br />
This movie will probably offend a lot of people, which is really why I love it.<br />
<br />
It scores really high with the music. All the songs made for the movie are not only relevant spoofs, but pretty fucking hilarious.<br />
<br />
Too much reliance upon "dick jokes." Will probably turn a lot of viewers away. Oh well, that's life.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Good movie, go watch in theaters.</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=102</a></font></center>
