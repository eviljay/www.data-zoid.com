As I’ve said in the past, I don’t let that stuff get in the way of my movie experience too often, but some people do. So if you’re some sort of Mythology buff, you’ll probably get mad at this movie “OMG THEY KILLED PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T DIE!!111111”<br />
<br />
Probably the biggest issue of difference which one could contend “ruins” it would be the total whitewashing of anything involving the Gods’ collective meddling. In the Illiad, this was a major component of the story. The film eliminated anything more than character’s mentioning their beliefs in them, and even then a healthy amount of doubt was added in to some other characters. <br />
<br />
The reason this is important is that the major theme for much of the Illiad was how much people AREN’T in control of their lives, how the Gods and fate can really fuck you over. On the other hand, eliminating this aspect allows for a more closely humanistic telling of the story, and helps bring it to life for today’s religiously intolerant audiences. <br />
<br />
It’s a tradeoff, and the question is whether or not you’re anal about details. <br />
<br />
For me, the inaccuracies did hurt the story, the biggest one being how the film seems to take place in a lot shorter time span than the Illiad had things go. Even then, they hit all the major points, Achilles was still a Douchebag to Agamemnon and vice versa, and Odysseus was still the best character ever.<br />
<br />
This movie suffers most from “MUST HAVE SHOT OF GIANT ARMY” syndrome that is so prevalent in war movies. Such shots generally look fake, and are then usually alternated with quick 5 second flashes of battle. Despite this, it was refreshing to see a battle of people fighting people for once. Things seem so much more intense than “Computer generated Robots VS Computer generated people” Or “Robots VS Zombies” or whatever combo is used. Real people fighting real people, if done right, is much more intense than even the best CG. Then again, the best CG is the CG you don’t notice as computerized.<br />
<br />
The fact that much of the City set was real shows through, and the technical accomplishments of the movie cannot be overstated. The fight sequence between Achilles and Hector was suitably well choreographed, finally moving away from the trend of over-the-top martial arts or Magical-impossible maneuvers. <br />
<br />
Not too much I can say for the story. It’s based off the fucking Illiad. What else is there? The sudden manner in which the two opposing armies would stop fighting might irk some who prefer today’s total-war fun, but I found it interesting and realistic as to the purpose of armies at that time.<br />
<br />
The movie does a real good job of being morally ambiguous. The Illiad itself always favored the Greeks heavily, but this story creates a balance, where you don’t really know who to root for. Only thing you do know is Achilles can be a jackass when someone pisses him off, and Paris (Orlando Bloom) is useless. The moral ambiguity kicks the story up another notch, making up for the loss of theme discussed earlier. <br />
<br />
The acting is generally good, though Pitt and Bloom suffer from a slight touch of tight casting. I half expected Pitt to get up and make a speech, “The first rule of the Trojan Horse is you do not talk about the Trojan Horse.” And where have we recently seen Bloom as a pretty-boy with a bow and arrow, standing back and generally being useless in battle? Despite this, they fit the roles well, as do all the characters. <br />
<br />
I liked this movie, and despite its inaccuracies, found it entertaining for the full 3 hours, and well worth the money to see on the big screen.<br />
<br />
My biggest disappointment was that Oddyseus made no comment about wanting to go home after the war was over...</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=91</a></font></center>
