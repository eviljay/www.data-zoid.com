Reign Of Fire was a brilliant concept which was turned into a steaming bucket of snot by arse-scrapingly bad filmmaking. The Core is a mind-numbingly stupid concept incredibly well produced.<br />
<br />
The story, such as it is, is this:<br />
<br />
The Earth's core has stopped rotating. To be honest, I didn't know it ever started, but hey. Due to the no-longer-rotating core, pigeons cannot fly straight (which is bad, apparently, particularly when one of them is actually a trout), Rome collapses (which is bad, apparently), the Golden Gate Bridge bursts into flames (also bad, I'm told) and, if left untended, the world will end in about three months.<br />
<br />
So, Dr. "I'm Not Seann William Scott, Honest" teams up with Hilary "I'm Not A Man, Honest" Swank, That Black Bloke Out Of Every Other Movie(tm), some irritating pseudo-British cockhead and GENERIC FRENCH ACTOR to ride a giant dildo into the heart of infernum. I swear to Christ I'm not making this up.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it uses magic lasers that can cut through rock. Except, inexplicably, on the way back up again, when the lasers cease to work and the dildo miraculously pops up out of a volcano to the dulcet tones of "WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T YOU JUST GO DOWN A VOLCANO IN THE FIRST PLACE".<br />
<br />
Anyhow.<br />
<br />
's alright. For what it is. </font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=95</a></font></center>
