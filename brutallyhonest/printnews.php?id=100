Night Shyamalan's supposed shocker "twists."<br />
<br />
To me, his movies are always funnier than they are scary. He is pretty good at building suspense, and he's pretty good with the creepy imagery.<br />
<br />
But there's just something about his movies..<br />
<br />
I laughed most the way through Signs, and mocked him for appearing as a small part in his own film as the character who happens to pretty much have everything figured out. <br />
<br />
Well, he did it again in this film, but to a much less obvious and more tolerable extent. Still, I couldn't help but chuckle loudly in the theater. (I didn't disturb anyone though, the crying baby a couple rows over was handling that for everyone.)<br />
<br />
Okay, I'd hate to spoil the movie for you, so I won't. But the story pretty much takes the entire plotline of "Running Out Of Time," a book by Margaret Peterson Haddix, for 5th-8th graders that I read in Elementary school, replaces some parts with "Little Red Riding Hood," (Something Shyamalan admits to himself) shakes it up with some creepy imagery, and throws it up on screen.<br />
<br />
Now, I liked that book as a kid, and always hope they'd make a movie out of it. But I came to see the Village, a supposed creepfest which actually seemed to start out pretty well.<br />
<br />
Okay, so maybe it's a fluke I just happened to have read the book this movie more likely than not jacked its story from. If you want to be surprised, then don't look up or know the book.<br />
<br />
The movie is pretty good. Acting seems awkward at first, but the characters come into their own, to the point that some play their parts pretty damn well. There are some sudden plot developments that threw me off guard, which offset what I found to be an all too predictable experience.<br />
<br />
So to those who have no idea why I'm rambling about the story being obvious, then I *do* recommend this film. It's entertaining, if slow paced in some parts.<br />
<br />
All in all:<br />
Good Imagery<br />
Moderate plot pacing<br />
Good (if randomly lifted from elsewhere) story.<br />
Humor and creepy parts.<br />
<br />
Pretty much standard fair for any M. Night Shyamalan movie. If you're into the Sixth Sense, Signs, etc. then this film is right up your alley.</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=100</a></font></center>
