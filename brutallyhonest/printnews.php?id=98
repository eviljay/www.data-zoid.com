But really, for an inflammatory 1 sided "documentary" meant to influence an election, it's pretty good. Even if you disagree with Moore, you have to give him credit for making interesting films. I called shennanigans on a lot of his "facts" in Bowling for Columbine, but still realized how entertaining it was and respected its points. Same goes for this movie.<br />

I suppose for me, the biggest disappointment was.. If you follow the Rotten Library's postings on relevant events pertaining to the topic, along with a casual look at non-American news, then you pretty much know most of the shit that's in this movie, which gets people so riled up.<br />
<br />
Still, an entertaining enough presentation with powerful imagery in some cases which needs to be seen by everyone, so they at least see one point of view.</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=98</a></font></center>
