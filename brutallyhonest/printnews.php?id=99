Best movie I've seen in about 3 years, easily. Sam Raimi once again proves that he is a God among Men. AND IT HAS BRUCE CAMPBELL IN.<br><br><br />
<br />
Ergo, movie rocked. Rawked. Rawwwwked.<br />
<br />
That's the end of my Fanboy review. Time for a proper one.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mmmkay. 2 years since the last Spidey film. First one was good, but flawed. Origin movies are always awkward..whilst better than most, it had a lot of down-points. Still a great movie though. Spidey 2 takes those flaws and stamps on them. Repeatedly. With size 24 boots. Made of steel. ON MARS.<br />
<br />
First off, and the weakest point of the first film, CGI. Yes, it's very flashy and so on and so forth. But it's more the virtual camera that impresses. Humans still don't look quite..human..but you barely have time to notice. Raimi was always a genius with camera trickery..now that he's no longer tied to a 4th dimension, he's free to reign. The camera never stops during action scenes, yet without cutting too many times. Few films have looked so..fluid and dynamic. Even with Spidey just swinging about the city, Raimi uses every trick he's ever known, and experiments with a few more. Worth seeing just for the cinematography alone. Few people know how to frame shots as well as Raimi.<br />
<br />
Second. Acting. The first movie suffered a bit from "Mid-twenties playing teens" syndrome. Seeing as how they're all-growed-up in this one, that doesn't come into play. The characters have generally been strengthened too, most notably Harry Osbourne, with Franco putting in a pretty damn good performance. He'll be back for Spidey 3, though. That much is obvious. They'd better improve the Green Goblin costume though.<br />
<br />
Third. Story. It's stronger. Lifted directly from one of the most famous Spidey comics, even echoing a few shots from it, it's definitely a step-up from before. They tend to use some Useless Science Crap though. TRI-IDIUM FUELS TEH SUN!!111<br />
<br />
Yes. Anyway.<br />
<br />
It's a lot more..humane than the first one. There's some genuinely touching scenes, which are slightly better than the "tribute to New York" in the first one. It does suffer from cliche a fair bit though, especially when "Kid who believed in Spider-man all along helps him find the strength to continue!" kinda way.<br />
<br />
Eh. I think I'm about done. But references! I need to point out references, just so I can prove that I overly examine films to the point of stupidity.<br />
<br />
Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head. Used to emphasise Parker's new-found freedom from Spiderman, that life is good and so on.Used exactly the same as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.<br />
<br />
Evil Dead. Whee. There's a tonne of references to it. Most notably in Harry Osbourne's mansion...the knife he picks up is the same design as the sacrificial dagger from ED1. There's a few Army of Darkness points too..but they're quite hard to stop.<br />
<br />
BRUCE CAMPBELL. Snooty Usher. Bah. Bruce Campbell deserves more. He was allegedly offered the part of Octavius, but turned it down. He thought he wasn't a strong enough actor. BRUCE FREAKIN' CAMPBELL. The man is a legend. LEGEND.<br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
Yes. Now I'm done. Spidey 3 will most likely rock. BUT IF THEY DON'T INCLUDE VENOM I'M GOING TO STAMP MY FEET AND CRY. They've got five ways they could go now.<br />
<br />
Most likely - Harry Osbourne, after finding the Goblin Lair, becomes the new Green Goblin/HobGoblin.<br />
<br />
Kinda likely - Dr. Connors mutates into the Lizard after trying to grow his arm back..hinted at, but not overly suggested.<br />
<br />
Almost plausible - Doc Ock returns. He isn't dead, after all. And death never stopped most supervillains anyway. Even after they've been converted back to good.<br />
<br />
Not very likely - John Jameson/Wolf Man. Flight into outerspace, cosmic rays, turns into a werewolf. Nah. 'Twas a crap comic. Would make a crap movie.<br />
<br />
WHAT THEY SHOULD FREAKIN' DO - Venom. Perfect for a three-act film. First act, Spidey-Symbiote. Second act, Venom rampage, Third act, big showdown between Spidey and Venom. Yes, yes oh yay.<br />
<br />
