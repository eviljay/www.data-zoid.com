<br><br>(Spoilers Ahoy. Stop reading now if you want the plot un-ruined. Just know this movie sucks, like all disaster movies reliant upon too much CG.)<br />
<br />
Right. A scientist (Dennis Quaid) foresees a global disaster involving polar ice caps. His theory is that the earth's natural cycle of heat will be disrupted, resulting in the "next ice age." Of course, New York City and LA are destroyed, and the UK is frozen solid. MANKIND IS DESTROYED.  Erm. What happened to Canada, Australia, Europe and Africa?<br />
<br />
Whatever.<br />
<br />
Sam(Donnie Darko) gets trapped in the NYC public library, along with his love interest, who doesn't know how he feels. Gag. NYC gets flooded, and a Russian ship floats by. Ohhkay. Then it gets really cold, and the water freezes. He had managed to get ahold of his Dad, who tells him to stay put, and he'll come find him. Then his chick gets sick, so Sam and a few other guys wander into the Russian ship looking for the medicine, they find the medical supplies, but are locked out. <br />
Damn.<br />
So, Donnie Darko grabs an axe, CLIMBS OUT THE WINDOW, and breaks into the room. Why didn't he just break down the door with the axe? Ohhkay.<br />
Then wolves, who escaped from the zoo sometime back, and managed to survive the flooding, and freezing, start chasing them. My attention span wavers, and they end up saving his chick and Donnie Darko tells him how he feels. Aw. His Dad turns up and saves them all.<br />
<br />
Aw. The feel good story of the year. With about 3 billion frozen people.</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=93</a></font></center>
