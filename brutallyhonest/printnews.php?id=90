<br />
I went into Van Helsing actually expecting to be entertained. I saw it almost exclusively because of the lead, and secondarily expecting some good old skool monster movie madness.<br />
<br />
I'm not one who bitches about "raping the classics." In many cases, I don't give a shit if they're accurate to early movie portrayals of Dracula or Frankenstein. Besides, the movie Frankenstein monster has never been much like Mary Shelley's original incarnation, and there is good reason for this. A Morose moping dipshit who goes living in a hole and fucking with his creator doesn't make for a very scary or exciting movie character.<br />
<br />
No ladies and gentlemen, Van Helsing is a bad movie because it was made, in and of itself, on its own, very poorly.<br />
<br />
1) CG is overplayed. The CG in this movie was poorly done, not even holding a candle to even the original Matrix, or even Lucas Arts' junk they've been shoveling out for prequels. This wouldn't matter so much in most cases, because we can all tolerate a little awkward CG as a quick solution to a difficult scene. It's better to have that in there than nothing at all, if it moves the story along. But this movie abuses CG way beyond what even the most dense of minds can tolerate. With the SINGULAR exception of the Wolfman's transformation sequences, the CG was fake, cartoony, and reminiscent of the Incredibly poorly rendered Hulk. Goofy-looking CG pretending to be climactic doesn't make for exciting fights or scary monsters. This movie subscribes to the recently discovered Hollywood philosophy of "We'll just add it all in on computer later" and it suffers for it. There is no denying that in comparison to other films with comparable budgets, the CG is subpar.<br />
<br />
2) The acting is stiff in many places. Most of this can be blamed by the heavy reliance upon CG here. It is DIFFICULT for actors to pull off convincing performances when half the set doesn't exist, and half the creatures they are talking to don't exist either. The Star Wars Prequels have suffered from this same obstacle. The majority of Hollywood's current actors are not trained to be doing what is essentially single-person-stage-performances. The acting generally comes off as flat, stiff, and unconvincing, no matter how well the script is conceived. Jackman had the most experience with this sort of endeavor, and it shows. His acting stands as convincing and at least believable. In contrast, the character who plays Dracula is neither scary or amusing. If this movie was meant tongue-in-cheek, it would have shown in the main villain. Instead, he just sucked. A lot.<br />
<br />
3) I stated before that even if the script was awesome, it is difficult to pull off good (either dramatic, action, or comedic) performances with this setup. Unfortunately for this film, the plot was utterly terrible. TERRIBLE! It makes me want to cry just thinking about it. Whoever thought this was funny, or "good," should be chucked off a cliff.<br />
<br />
Imagine the conception of this film:<br />
"Okay.. so.. you got Dracula.. Right? And.. He wants to have babies.. Well see, he can have babies, but they are born as cacoons or something. So he needs uh.. Frankenstein's monster to make them live and not spontaneously explode!! DRACULA WANTS TO BE A DADDY!"<br />
<br />
This IS the premise of the film. I'm not spoiling anything, and I swear I am not lying to you. Van Helsing comes in as sort of a James Bond/Wolverine/Vapire Slayer fellow dispatched by the Vatican (yes, the same Vatican that was slaughtering anyone who believed in this sort of shit all across Europe at the time) because he conveniently doesn't remember his past but is the only one who can fix things blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
Now raise your hand if you think Van Helsing's lack of memory about "the past" DOESN'T have something to do with Dracula. <br />
<br />
Boy are you gonna be surprised. Oh, and the girl Bond meets in his next movie ISN'T going to actually be working for the bad guy...<br />
<br />
This movie abuses almost every cliche there is, and it does so poorly. Don't give me that "It's MEANT TO B TEAHT WAY!!!11111111" crap either. If it was, it wouldn't be advertised as it is, and it wouldn't have the pricetag it does, and it would have actually been funny. (With the exception of the obligatory bumbling comic relief character, who is always worth a laugh.) <br />
<br />
If you're also one of those "But it's just a pointless summer film" folks, then understand this: There can be GOOD summer action films. The fact that it isn't Mulhollond Drive doesn't excuse the painfully terrible lines, writing, and actions taken in this movie. The plot is jilted, has no flow to it, and generally makes no logical sense even in the "I suspended my disbelief, expelled it, exorcised it, and burned it" sort of way. <br />
<br />
The main mode of travel in this film appears to be swinging from ropes. You know the scene, where one of the characters swings from a rope all dashing like, usually over a chasm, to get somewhere very quickly and save the day... Well, this movie has this scene in it. Ok. But then, after using this particular cliche, they do it again. And AGAIN. In fact, I'm pretty damn sure every fucking character in the movie gets a chance to do the dashing "SWING FROM THE ROPE!" scene at least once. Don't believe me? Frankenstein's monster does it. <br />
<br />
Come on folks, that's just fucking lazy right there.<br />
<br />
All of these things, and I mean every last one of them, can be forgiven. (Hell, I forgave Jar Jar Binks and half of Matrix Revolutions.)<br />
<br />
But when I say the action is bad, I mean atrocious. What comes next will likely include real spoilers, so if you actually plan on watching this movie, skip to the last two paragraphs of this review.<br />
<br />
-----Spoiler Shit-----<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The characters in this movie take an insane amount of beatings. They literally get thrown through walls and shit. The action includes many scenes where the results of their actions would be fatal. This is ok. Anyone who's seen DBZ is used to people flying through mountains and shit. But, they fail to maintain any consistency at all. Characters only get hurt when it is convenient for the storyline, such as with Van Helsing VS the Wolfman (Number 2.. 3? Lost count by then)<br />
<br />
The female protagonist gets fucked up real bad, but seems only to suffer a bleeding lip. This is after being thrown up walls, off cliffs, swinging from a few ropes, being fucked up by the Wolfman and ugly vampire chicks, explosions, etc etc etc. But in the end, when she has to go calm down the wolfman-transformed Helsing after he predictably beats Dracula, Helsing throws her on a couch. And she dies. I kid you not. The lady who flies through brick walls and walks off 5 seconds later gets tossed on a couch, may or may not be laid on by the oversized dog, and dies. BEWARE THE COUCH! After I saw this part, I simply couldn't stop laughing. Before this and definitely DURING this part, people got up and left the theater I was in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-----No More Spoiler Shit----<br />
<br />
THey try to tie in Helsing with some religious crap, since that seems to be in vogue with Hollywood at the moment, but it is forced and takes a back seat to the rope swinging. In fact, it's so contradictary to the nature of the character, I'd be mildly offended if I actually gave a shit about such references. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, this movie TRIES to be a fun summer action flick with a unique character, but is so poorly executed that all the actually GOOD ideas in the film, such as the early-movie throwback style sequence in the beginning, get buried under mounds of crap. The film rips off other movies shamelessly without differentiating enough to be considered parody (or a sublte nod) and the overuse of bad CG ruins what might have been a watchable experience. In parts, the flaws of this movie could be ignored, but when added all together, it becomes too much for me to recommend you paying Theater prices for. That's the brutal, and honest truth. If you really dig Goth style action, or love those old horror flicks, Van Helsing might make for a good rental. But only a rental.</font></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><center> <font face="arial" size="2"><a href="">Brutality Abound.</a><br>http://www.data-zoid.com/brutallyhonest/printnews.php?id=90</a></font></center>
