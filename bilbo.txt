Now hobbits are peace lovin' folks y'know
They're never in a hurry and they take things slow
They don't like to travel away from home
They just want to eat and be left alone

But one day bilbo was asked to go
On a big adventure (something something) below
To help some poor (something) back their gold
That was stolen by a dragon in they days of old

Lost in the forest
Escaped in a barrel (?)
That the elves did (something)
